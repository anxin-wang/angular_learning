        I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

        <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
            instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see
            script.js for details)

        Hello, {{name}}!

        <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
            instantiate, by using explicit annotation style
            (see script.js for details)

    <div ng-controller="BadController">
        I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

        <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying
            on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in
            strict mode). As such, the content of this section is not
            interpolated, and there should be an error in your web console.
